       _Q_m_o_d enables users classified as _o_w_n_e_r_s (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5) for details)
       of a workstation to modify the state of Grid Engine queues for  his/her
       machine  as  well as the state of his/her own jobs.  A manager/operator
       or root can execute _q_m_o_d for any queue and job in a  cluster  but  only
       from  administrative  hosts.   Find  additional  information concerning
       _w_c___q_u_e_u_e___l_i_s_t and _w_c___j_o_b___l_i_s_t in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

       --cc     NNoottee:: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.  Please  use
              the --ccjj or --ccqq switch instead.
              Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s)/queue(s).

       --ccjj    Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s).

       --ccqq    Clears the error state of the specified queue(s).

       --dd     Disables  the  queue(s),  i.e. no further jobs are dispatched to
              disabled queues while jobs already executing in these queues are
              allowed to finish.

       --ee     Enables the queue(s).

       --ff     Force the modification action for the queue despite the apparent
              current state of the queue. For example if a queue appears to be
              suspended  but the job execution seems to be continuing the man-
              ager/operator can force a suspend operation which  will  send  a
              SIGSTOP  to  the jobs. In any case, the queue or job status will
              be set even if the _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) controlling the queues/jobs can-
              not be reached. Requires manager/operator privileges.

       --hheellpp  Prints a listing of all options.

       --rr     NNoottee::  Deprecated, may be removed in future release.  Please use
              the --rrjj or --rrqq switch instead.
              If applied to queues, reschedules all jobs currently running  in
              this  queue.   If applied to running jobs, reschedules the jobs.
              Requires root or manager privileges.  In order for a job  to  be
              rescheduled,  it or the queue in which it is executing must have
              the rerun flag activated.  (See -r option  in  the  _q_s_u_b(1)  man
              page and the _r_e_r_u_n option in the _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5) man page for more
              information.)  Additional restrictions apply  for  parallel  and
              checkpointing  jobs.  (See the _r_e_s_c_h_e_d_u_l_e___u_n_k_n_o_w_n description in
              the _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5) man page for details).

       --rrjj    If applied to running jobs, reschedules the jobs. Requires  root
              or manager privileges.

       --rrqq    If  applied to queues, reschedules all jobs currently running in
              this queue.  Requires root or manager privileges.

       --ss     NNoottee:: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.  Please  use
              the --ssjj or --ssqq switch instead.
              If  applied  to  queues,  suspends the queues and any jobs which
              might be active. If applied to running jobs, suspends the  jobs.

       --ssjj    If  applied to running jobs, suspends the jobs. If a job is both
              suspended explicitly and via suspension of its queue, a  follow-
              ing unsuspend of the queue will not release the suspension state
              on the job.

       --ssqq    If applied to queues, suspends the queues  and  any  jobs  which
              might be active.

       --uuss    NNoottee::  Deprecated, may be removed in future release.  Please use
              the --uussjj or --uussqq switch instead.
              If applied to queues, unsuspends the queues and any  jobs  which
              might be active. If applied to jobs, unsuspends the jobs.

       --uussjj   If  applied  to jobs, unsuspends the jobs. If a job is both sus-
              pended explicitly and via suspension of its queue,  a  following
              unsuspend  of the queue will not release the suspension state on
              the job.

       --uussqq   If applied to queues, unsuspends the queues and any  jobs  which
              might be active.

                      figuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine  cell.  To
                      address  a  Grid  Engine cell _q_m_o_d uses (in the order of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.

                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten to stderr. In addition the level of detail in  which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__QQMMAASSTTEERR__PPOORRTT
                      If  set,  specifies the tcp port on which _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.   Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
