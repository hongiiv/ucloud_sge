       request  to  be allowed to display their GUI on the visible Desktop. It
       is a Win32 service that is  started  at  boot  time  under  the  SYSTEM
       account,  giving it the permissions to give any process the permissions
       to access the visible Desktop.
       This service runs independently of the _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8)  (i.e.  it  is  not
       started  and  stopped together with the execution daemon) and there can
       be only one SGE_Helper_Service.exe per host.
       Jobs can request to be allowed to display  their  GUI  on  the  visible
       desktop  by  requesting  the  resource  "display_win_gui" (qsub -l dis-
       play_win_gui=1). See _s_u_b_m_i_t(1) , option "-v", for information on how to
       set a job environment variable.
       When running GUI jobs, the environment variable SGE_BACKGND_MODE can be
       used to direct where the output of the GUI will be  displayed.  If  the
       environment  variable  SGE_BACKGND_MODE is set to "TRUE" or "1" and "-l
       display_win_gui=true" is requested, the job is started  by  the  helper
       service,  but  the  GUI  is  not opened on the execution host's screen.
       Instead it is opened on a virtual screen.
