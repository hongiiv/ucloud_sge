       host_aliases - Grid Engine host aliases file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       All Grid Engine components use a hostname resolving service provided by
       the communication library to identify hosts via a unique hostname.  The
       communication  library  itself  references standard UNIX directory ser-
       vices such as DNS, NIS and /etc/hosts to resolve  hostnames.   In  rare
       cases  these  standard services cannot be setup cleanly and Grid Engine
       communication daemons running on different hosts are unable to automat-
       ically  determine  a  unique hostname for one or all hosts which can be
       used on all hosts. In such situations a Grid Engine host  aliases  file
       can  be  used  to  provide the communication daemons with a private and
       consistent hostname resolution database.

       The location  for  the  host  aliases  file  is  _<_s_g_e___r_o_o_t_>_/_<_c_e_l_l_>_/_c_o_m_-
       _m_o_n_/_h_o_s_t___a_l_i_a_s_e_s_.

       For  each  host  a  single line must be provided with a blank, comma or
       semicolon separated list  of  hostname  aliases.  The  first  alias  is
       defined to be the uunniiqquuee hostname which will be used by all Grid Engine
       components using the hostname aliasing  service  of  the  communication
       library.
